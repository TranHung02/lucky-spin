🎡 Lucky Wheel Game (Vòng quay may mắn)

A simple and fun Lucky Wheel project built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Players can spin the wheel to get random prizes — with an interactive animation, confetti celebration, and even a separate result window that updates in real time.

🚀 Features

🎨 Smooth spinning animation with easing.

🎯 Random result generation based on “modes”.

💡 CapsLock toggles between “Reward mode (có quà)” and “No reward mode (ko quà)”.

🎉 Colorful confetti effect after each spin.

🪟 Real-time result window opens in a new tab and updates automatically.

💻 Fully responsive, works on any modern browser.

🧩 How It Works

Click “QUAY” to spin the wheel.

The wheel randomly selects a segment based on your current mode.

When CapsLock is ON, only prize-related sectors can be selected.

When CapsLock is OFF, non-prize sectors are more likely.

The result appears both in the main screen and in a separate result tab.
